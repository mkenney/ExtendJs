ExtendJs
========

Javascript functionality I think is missing and re-create often.

I'm totally polluting the prototypes of built in classes. I don't feel bad about
it. Nothing here will interfere with other libraries or break for .. in loops or
conflict with future versions of javascript or anything else. Just include it last.
